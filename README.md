 # Pineapple Chess Engine

 A chess engine designed to work with the Universal Chess Interface.
 
 This is a basic Rust project - simply use the `cargo build --release` to build the binary and use any popular chess GUI (such as [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)) to run it.

 This project is a port of [Maksim Korzh's](https://github.com/maksimKorzh) [BBC chess engine](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/bbc).
 
 He has made a series of YouTube videos showing the development process of his engine, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUNP-UjujBM&list=PLmN0neTso3Jxh8ZIylk74JpwfiWNI76Cs).
 In my opinion, this is the single best online resource to learn how a conventional chess engine works, and I highly recommend watching it!
